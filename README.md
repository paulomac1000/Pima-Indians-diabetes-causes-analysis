# Python-Machine-Learning
Project for university subject "Systemy Rekomendacyjne" (eng: Recommendation Systems). Language: Pytahon. Using Anaconda distribution, "The Jupyter Notebook". Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikid-learn. I'm analysing dataset "Pima Indians Diabetes Data Set" (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/pima+indians+diabetes) and try to estimate likelihood of diabetes depending on datas like weight, age, number of times pregnant etc.
# How run?
Install https://www.anaconda.com/download/ version 3.x and select option to add path, open console, switch to project folder and type "jupyter notebook". Do not close console, switch to newly open browser. Select "Python-Machine-Learning.ipynb". That's all. You can see all of my progress.
